## Conformance

* Tests for OpenStack Powered Compute 2020.11 successful for Wallaby (https://refstack.openstack.org/#/results/054e85a0-857e-49c5-906c-3e124a1fdd03)
* OSISM is officially OpenStack Powered and listed in the marketplace (https://www.openstack.org/marketplace/distros/distribution/osism/osism)
* Designate and Heat are now also tested for Wallaby

## Fixes

* In the inventory reconciler the import into the NetBox was fixed
* The image of patchman was changed to Ubuntu to fix problems when using libapt
* In Patchman, Ubuntu 20.04 was added as a distribution
* For Wallaby a missing backport for Fluentd has been added which now also adds
  the possibility to enable the watch timer for Wallaby. This solves issues with
  delivering logs from local Fluentd process to Elasticsearch. The Watch Timer is
  activated by default. This is not the case in the upstream of kolla-ansible.
* The resources provided by Cadvisor were limited to solve high load problems

## Infrastructure

* An Elasticsearch service is now available for integration into the CI
* A Kibana service is now available for the evaluation of the logs from the CI
* A new Minio service is available for binary artifacts like machine images
* Plusserver provides resources on the Pluscloudopen for daily deployments
* It is now possible to set the permissions of all repositories in the osism
  organisation via the github-permissions repository
* Most of the container images have been consolidated in the central
  ``container-images`` repository
* An so-called overlord service (``osism/github-actions-overlord``) is now
  available that can trigger defined reactions to commits on various repositories
* The Harbor service has moved to a much larger storage system so that Docker
  images of PRs etc. can be built in the future.

## Security

* Log4j 2.x mitigation implemented in Ansible defaults for Elasticsearch

## To be considered for upgrades

* Playbook ``generic-configuration.yml`` was deprecated. From now on, please
  use the playbook of the same name in the manager environment (``manager-configuration.yml``).
  All configuration parameters from ``environments/configuration.yml`` should be moved
  to ``environments/manager/configuration.yml``.
