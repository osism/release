6.0.1
=====

Release date: 15. October 2023

Both on REGIO.cloud and on the SCS environment at Plusserver there were problems in the
interaction of Octavia with Neutron.
``octavia.network.base.PlugVIPException: Bad port request: A virtual logical switch port cannot be bound to a host.`` A hoffix was added to the Neutron code. This is the only change in this release.

The previously necessary change in ``environments/kolla/images.yml`` can be removed again.

It is sufficient to update the manager from ``6.0.0`` to ``6.0.1`` and update Neutron on the
control plane. No further upgrades of other services are required with this release.
