=====
5.0.0
=====

.. warning::

   Release 5.0.0 is currently under development. It is not available at the moment.

Features
========

* `OpenStack Services Action <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstack-services-action>`_ now
  uses OpenStack Zed as the default OpenStack release
* `Mitogen <https://mitogen.networkgenomics.com/ansible_detailed.html>`_ is installed
  in all Ansible containers and can be used

  The use of the Mitogen strategy plugin for Ansible can be enabled via ``ansible.cfg``
  in the ``environments`` directory

  .. code-block:: ini

     [defaults]
     strategy_plugins = /usr/share/ansible/plugins/mitogen/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
     strategy = mitogen_linear

* In order to avoid having to install the manager and, if necessary, the control nodes
  manually when setting up a new OSISM environment, an ISO image is now available.
  `osism/node-image <https://github.com/osism/node-image>`_ automatically installs a new
  node with Ubuntu 22.04 on a software RAID 1 and prepares everything to be able to start
  directly.

OpenStack image manager
-----------------------

* `OpenStack image manager <https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager>`_ now published
  at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/openstack-image-manager/>`_
* `Netbox plugin OSISM <https://github.com/osism/netbox-plugin-osism>`_ now published
  at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/netbox-plugin-osism/>`_
* A container image ``harbor.services.osism.tech/osism/openstack-image-manager:latest`` is
  now available which also contains the default image definitions in ``/etc/openstack-image-manager``
* It is possible to define meta-information to individual versions of an image

  .. code-block:: yaml

     - name: Sample image
       [...]
       meta:
         architecture: x86_64
       versions:
         - version: '1.0'
           [...]
           meta:
             image_build_date: YYYY-MM-DD

OSISM manager
-------------

* Support for routeros, which could be used to control Mikrotik devices, has been removed.
  Mikrotik devices were only used by the OSISM project itself in a baremetal testbed. Due
  to the change of the network hardware used by the OSISM project, only SONiC will be
  supported as NOS in the future.
* If `osism <https://pypi.org/project/osism/>`_ is installed via PyPI, Ansible is no longer
  installed as a dependency. This ensures that the services can also be used with older
  Ansible versions. If Ansible is to be installed as well, this can be done via an extra
  requirement using ``osism[ansible]``.
* Since only SONiC will be supported in the future, the following Ansible collections,
  which were previously available as technical previews, have been removed: ``arista.cvp``,
  ``arista.eos``, ``juniper.device``.

Deprecations
============

* The role ``osism.services.bird`` is deprecated. In future, FRRouting (``osism.services.frr``)
  will be used.

Removals
========

* Monasca was deprecated in Kolla. In preparation for the introduction of Monasca in OSISM
  (which will no longer happen after deprecation), two infrastructure services required only
  by Monasca have already been built as images: Kafka, Storm, and Zookeeper. These images were
  removed without prior deprecation as they were only available for the planned Monasca
  integration and are not yet in use anywhere.
