=====
5.0.0
=====

.. warning::

   Release 5.0.0 is currently under development. It is not available at the moment.

Features
========

* `OpenStack Services Action <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openstack-services-action>`_ now
  uses OpenStack Zed as the default OpenStack release
* `Mitogen <https://mitogen.networkgenomics.com/ansible_detailed.html>`_ is installed
  in all Ansible containers and can be used

  The use of the Mitogen strategy plugin for Ansible can be enabled via ``ansible.cfg``
  in the ``environments`` directory

  .. code-block:: ini

     [defaults]
     strategy_plugins = /usr/share/ansible/plugins/mitogen/ansible_mitogen/plugins/strategy
     strategy = mitogen_linear

* The testbed has been significantly simplified for new operators and developers and a Quick Start
  guide has been added
* In order to avoid having to install the manager and, if necessary, the control nodes
  manually when setting up a new OSISM environment, an ISO image is now available.
  `osism/node-image <https://github.com/osism/node-image>`_ automatically installs a new
  node with Ubuntu 22.04 on a software RAID 1 and prepares everything to be able to start
  directly.
* With the playbook ``ceph-purge-storage-node`` it is possible to remove all Ceph services
  on a Ceph storage node and remove all Ceph related data and configuration files.
* With the playbook ``ceph-purge-cluster`` it is possible to remove all Ceph services
  on all Ceph nodes and remove all Ceph related data and configuration files.
* `Netbox plugin OSISM <https://github.com/osism/netbox-plugin-osism>`_ now published
  at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/netbox-plugin-osism/>`_
* With the Ansible role ``osism.services.osquery`` `osquery <https://www.osquery.io>`_
  can be deployed. osquery uses basic SQL commands to leverage a relational data-model to
  describe a device. It will be used in OSISM in the future to obtain facts about system
  states.

OpenStack image manager
-----------------------

* Some of the images (Almalinux, Rockylinux, Ubuntu) defined in ``etc/images`` are now
  automatically updated once a week
* `OpenStack image manager <https://github.com/osism/openstack-image-manager>`_ now published
  at `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/openstack-image-manager/>`_
* A container image ``harbor.services.osism.tech/osism/openstack-image-manager:latest`` is
  now available which also contains the default image definitions in ``/etc/openstack-image-manager``
* It is possible to define meta-information to individual versions of an image

  .. code-block:: yaml

     - name: Sample image
       [...]
       meta:
         architecture: x86_64
       versions:
         - version: '1.0'
           [...]
           meta:
             image_build_date: YYYY-MM-DD

* With the ``--validate`` parameter, it is possible to check the images available on an
  OpenStack environment for conformity with the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) image standard.
* With the ``--check`` parameter, it is possible to check the correctness of local image
  definitions.
* With the parameter ``--filter`` it is possible to filter the list of images to be processed
  by their names with regular expressions. E.g. ``--filter "Ubuntu 2\d.\d\d"`` can be used
  to process all Ubuntu images with a version >= 20.04.
* The ``--images`` parameter can now be passed a single file in addition to a directory with
  YAML files with included image definitions
* All parameters marked as mandatory by the Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS) image standard are
  now set or requested accordingly if they are not set.

OSISM manager
-------------

* Support for routeros, which could be used to control Mikrotik devices, has been removed.
  Mikrotik devices were only used by the OSISM project itself in a baremetal testbed. Due
  to the change of the network hardware used by the OSISM project, only SONiC will be
  supported as NOS in the future.
* If `osism <https://pypi.org/project/osism/>`_ is installed via PyPI, Ansible is no longer
  installed as a dependency. This ensures that the services can also be used with older
  Ansible versions. If Ansible is to be installed as well, this can be done via an extra
  requirement using ``osism[ansible]``.
* Since only SONiC will be supported in the future, the following Ansible collections,
  which were previously available as technical previews, have been removed: ``arista.cvp``,
  ``arista.eos``, ``juniper.device``.
* The new Ansible collection `osism.sonic <https://github.com/osism-sonic/ansible-collection-sonic>`_,
  a downstream of
  `dellemc.enterprise_sonic <https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic>`_,
  is used to manage SONiC.
* With ``enable_auditd`` it is possible to disable the ``osism.services.auditd`` role
  in the bootstrap and maintenance playbooks
* With the ``dump facts`` command, it is possible to output the facts of Ansible for
  specific systems.

* With the ``log container`` command, it is possible to get the logs of a container.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism log container mgr003 fluentd
     + sudo -E kolla_set_configs
     INFO:__main__:Loading config file at /var/lib/kolla/config_files/config.json
     INFO:__main__:Validating config file
     INFO:__main__:Kolla config strategy set to: COPY_ALWAYS
     INFO:__main__:Copying service configuration files
     [...]

* With the ``validate`` command, it is possible to run validators, e.g. for Ceph. If you call the
  ``validate`` command without further parameters, all available validators will be displayed.

  The validators used are available in the Ansible collection
  `osism.validations <https://github.com/osism/ansible-collection-validations>`_.

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism validate ulimits

     PLAY [Run ulimits validator] ***************************************************

     TASK [osism.validations.ulimits : Get nofiles limit] ***************************

     [...]

* ``ansible.utils`` and ``kubernetes.core`` Ansible collections are now usable.

* The ``console`` command now allows shortcuts to select specific console types

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism console ctl003  # SSH
     dragon@ctl003:~$

     $ osism console .ctl003  # Ansible
     Welcome to the ansible console. Type help or ? to list commands.

     dragon@ctl003 (1)[f:5]$

     $ osism console ctl003/rabbitmq  # Container
     (rabbitmq)[rabbitmq@ctl003 /]$

* The ``container`` command now allows the use of a prompt

  .. code-block:: console

     $ osism container ctl003

* So far, the facts have been updated every 10 minutes. This is not necessary. Through
  the standard use of Redis as a cache backend, the facts are kept 24 hours. The facts
  are now only updated every 12 hours.

Deprecations
============

* The role ``osism.services.bird`` is deprecated. In future, FRRouting (``osism.services.frr``)
  will be used.
* The role ``osism.services.minikube`` is deprecated. In future ``osism.services.k8s``
  will be used.
* Heat is deprecated in favor of more generic Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform
  as of now and will be removed in the future (exact removal date is not yet known)
* Magnum (currently available as Technical Preview) will be removed in favor of Gardener and
  Cluster API
* Mistral (currently available as Technical Preview) will be removed
* Swift (currently available as Technical Preview) will be removed in favor of Ceph RGW
* Trove (currently available as Technical Preview) will be removed in favor of Kubernetes
  database operators
* Skydive (currently available as Technical Preview) will be removed in the future, the
  project is not maintained anymore, last commit is 8th Jan 2022
  (https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/kolla/+/869191)
* The role ``osism.services.keycloak`` is deprecated and will be removed in the future
  (exact removal date is not yet known, the role will not be removed until the new
  Kubernetes management plane is usable and an IDM service is deployable there).
  The role was temporarily added to OSISM to provide a way to integrate against Gaia-X
  Federation Services. In the meantime, Lot 8 has been assigned in the SCS project, which
  is now taking care of the implementation of this layer. Therefore, OSISM will in future
  integrate against these layers provided by the SCS project.

Removals
========

* Monasca was deprecated in Kolla. In preparation for the introduction of Monasca in OSISM
  (which will no longer happen after deprecation), three infrastructure services required only
  by Monasca have already been built as images: Kafka, Storm, and Zookeeper. These images were
  removed without prior deprecation as they were only available for the planned Monasca
  integration and are not yet in use anywhere.
* The ``ospurge`` wrapper script has been removed from the ``osism.services.openstackclient`` role.
  The ospurge project is no longer compatible with the current OpenStack SDK. The command
  ``openstack project purge`` can be used as an alternative.
* Support for Zabbix was already removed in OSISM 3.0.0. The Ansible collection
  ``community.zabbix`` was still present as a leftover.

Housekeeping
============

* In all ``docker-compose.yml`` files the declaration of the version was removed. This is no
  longer necessary in the latest
  `Compose specification <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/>`_.

Upgrade notes
=============

* The ARA library has been updated to version ``1.6.x`` in all Ansible containers. If
  the version of the ARA server on the manager is lower than ``1.6.x`` problems may occur.
  When updating the Ansible container, the ARA server should also be updated to version
  ``1.6.x`` accordingly.
