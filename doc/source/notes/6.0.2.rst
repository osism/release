=====
6.0.2
=====

Release date: 26. November 2023

This is a maintenance update for the manager. The service images will not change.
These will only be updated in December with the release of OSISM 6.1.0.

It is sufficient to update the manager from ``6.0.0`` or ``6.0.1`` to ``6.0.2``.
No further upgrades of other services are required with this release.

Anyone still using ``/etc/interfaces`` for their network configuration must now
explicitly set ``network_type: interfaces``. The default in Ubuntu has been Netplan
for a long time and the default has now been adjusted in ``osism.commons.network``.
As a result, it is no longer necessary to explicitly set ``network_type: netplan``
in the configuration repository.

As a new feature, the inventory reconciler now automatically calculates the value
for ``ceph_rgw_hosts`` and ``cephclient_mons``. This means that these parameters
can be removed from the configuration repository in future.

The transfer of outputs from running Ansible playbooks on the workers has been
changed from Redis Pub/Sub to Redis Streams. This should make the transfer of
outputs much more stable.

From now on it is sufficient to adjust the ``manager_version`` in ``environments/manager/configuration.yml``
and then execute ``gilt overlay``. It is no longer necessary to specify the version
with ``MANAGER_VERSION``.

A detailed list of the changes will be added here when the script for reading the
new Reno relesenotes in the individual repositories is ready.
