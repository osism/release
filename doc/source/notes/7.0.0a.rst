**This is a pre-release. Do not use in production.**

First things first
==================

General notes
=============

* Shortly before the first pre-release, `gilt <https://github.com/retr0h/gilt>`_
  made a major release which led to breaking changes. It is therefore important
  for the moment to install python-gilt in a version < 2 when synchronising the
  configuration repository against the generics. In the CI and within the container
  images, we currently use `python-gilt == 1.2.3`.
