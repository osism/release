**This is a pre-release. Do not use in production.**

Report any feedback on this pre-release in the issues
`osism/issues#841 <https://github.com/osism/issues/issues/841>`_.

This pre-release is set in the configuration repository like a stable release.
Instructions for the upgrade can be found in the `upgrade guide <https://osism.github.io/docs/guides/upgrade-guide/manager>`_.

First things first
==================

* There is currently still a bug in part of the new Keycloak deployment.
  It is therefore currently not possible to use the Keycloak service itself
  or the Keycloak/Keystone integration. This will work again with the next
  pre-release.

* The Keycloak deployment via Docker Compose, which was previously included
  as a technical preview, has been completely revised and is now deployed on
  Kubernetes. No migration from the old deployment via Docker Compose to the
  new deployment via Kubernetes has been prepared. If you are currently using
  the Keycloak service, do not upgrade the Keycloak service and contact us in
  advance.

General notes
=============

* Shortly before the first pre-release, `gilt <https://github.com/retr0h/gilt>`_
  made a major release which led to breaking changes. It is therefore important
  for the moment to install python-gilt in a version < 2 when synchronising the
  configuration repository against the generics. In the CI and within the container
  images, we currently use ``python-gilt == 1.2.3``.

Deprecations
============

Removals
========

Housekeeping
============

To be considered
================

* The ``hosts_interface`` parameter is now set to ``internal_interface`` by default.

Upgrade notes
=============

* The use of ProxySQL for MariaDB is now possible and it is recommended to switch
  to it as part of the upgrade. The parameter ``enable_proxysql`` is added to
  ``environments/kolla/configuration.yml`` for this purpose.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     enable_proxysql: yes

  The secrets listed below (``proxysql_admin_password``, ``proxysql_stats_password``,
  ``mariadb_monitor_password``) must also be added or changed.

  When upgrading, it is important to update MariaDB first. This is followed by the
  load balancer. ProxySQL is deployed with the load balancer play.

* The following secrets must be added in ``environments/kolla/secrets.yml``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     prometheus_bcrypt_salt:       # generate with: pwgen 22 1 <-- there's a 22
     prometheus_grafana_password:  # generate with: pwgen 32 1
     prometheus_password:          # generate with: pwgen 32 1
     proxysql_admin_password:      # generate with: pwgen 32 1
     proxysql_stats_password:      # generate with: pwgen 32 1

* The parameter ``mariadb_monitoring_password`` in ``environments/kolla/secrets.yml``
  has to be renamed to ``mariadb_monitor_password``. If the parameter is not present,
  it is added.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     mariadb_monitor_password:     # generate with: pwgen 32 1

* The following parameters must be removed from the configuration repository from
  ``environments/kolla/configuration.yml``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     ceph_nova_user: nova
     ceph_nova_keyring: ceph.client.nova.keyring

* Parameters for the Netbox service in ``environments/infrastructure/configuration.yml`` or
  ``secrets.yml`` must now also be added in ``environments/manager/configuration.yml`` or
  ``secrets.yml``. In an upcoming  release, the parameters can be removed from the
  infrastructure environment.

* The Ansible callback plugin ``osism.commons.still_alive`` is now available to avoid timeouts
  for long-running tasks. This currently has to be explicitly enabled in the Ansible configuration.
  This is done in the ``environments/ansible.cfg`` file in the configuration repository.
  The callback plugin is enabled by default in the future.

  .. code-block:: ini

     [defaults]
     ...
     stdout_callback = osism.commons.still_alive

* In the inventory, the ``nova_backend`` parameter must be added to the host vars of
  compute nodes where local storage is used.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     nova_backend: default

* The persistence feature in Octavia was enabled by default. This requires an additional
  database, which is only created when Octavia play is run in bootstrap mode first.

  .. code-block:: none

     osism apply -a bootstrap octavia

Known issues
============

* The manager service is updated via ``osism update manager``. If this command is not yet
  available, you can use ``osism-update-manager`` as an alternative.

  .. code-block:: none

     osism: 'update manager' is not an osism command. See 'osism --help'.
