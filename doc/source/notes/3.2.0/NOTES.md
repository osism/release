# OSISM release 3.2.0

Regular release for updating the images.

Due to a bug in the container-images-kolla repository, the development versions
were tagged in the 3.1.0 release. Therefore, in some images of the 3.2.0 release,
the minor version is now smaller than in the 3.1.0 release. This is fine.
